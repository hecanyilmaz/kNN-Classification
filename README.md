# kNN-Classification
kNN Algorithm is an insantce-based learning algorithm. It's referred as "Lazy" learning. k-NN assumes that all instances are points in some n-dimensional space where n is the number of features while classifying the data. The k-NN classification rule is to assign to a test sample the majority categeory label of its k nearest training samples. k is need to be seleceted very carefully. If the k value is too small, it's sensitive to noise points. If k value is too large, neighbourhood may include points from other classes.

It's written in python and also from scratch.
